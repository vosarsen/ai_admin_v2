```

### 🎯 Benefits

1. **Clear Organization** - Files grouped by purpose and usage
2. **Easy Navigation** - Logical structure with README guides
3. **Clean Root** - No clutter in root directory
4. **Historical Preservation** - Archive maintains reference materials
5. **AI-Friendly** - CLAUDE.md updated for seamless AI navigation

### 📝 Notes

- All active development should use files in `src/`, `scripts/`, and `tests/`
- Archive directory is for reference only
- Documentation is now categorized for easier access
- Project management docs centralized in `config/project-docs/`

### ⚠️ Important

Remember to use the new paths when referencing documentation:
- Project context: `config/project-docs/CONTEXT.md`
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture/`
- Technical guides: `docs/technical/`
- Feature specs: `docs/features/`
