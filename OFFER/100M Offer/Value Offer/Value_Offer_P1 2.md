When I started my gym, I struggled. I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something. But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a $99/mo bootcamp. People would say, “LA Fitness is $29/mo. This is expensive.” I even tried getting people to start for free. They said they wouldn't bother because $99/mo afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they wouldn't continue with.
      It’s a new level of frustration when you can’t even give your services away for free to people. I felt worthless, and I didn't know what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers and books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy’s books, I was hooked.
      In his books, he talked about making “irresistible offers.” Again, this theme of “making an offer so good people would feel stupid to say no” kept re-appearing. But this time, remembering what TJ had told me, I decided to go all in on this concept, rather than just do what everyone else was doing.
      But how? Everyone else was selling $99/mo bootcamps. How was I going to compete? So I decided to look at what we did differently. I thought — what do they really want? No one wants a membership; they want to lose weight.
      Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome
      I had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there.
      
        Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks.
        Big dream outcome - lose 20lbs.
        With a decreased time delay - 6 weeks.
      
      Note: I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn’t selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation. When you are thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience.
 
     Step #2: List Problems
      Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the “next” thing they need help with? These are all the problems. 

Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you’ll continually be answering people’s next problem as it manifests..
      So, let’s go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect’s perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!). 

Example Problem List: Weight Loss
      First thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping
      
        Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it
        Buying healthy food will take too much time
        Buying healthy food is expensive
        I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know what to get.
      
      Next thing they must do: Cooking healthy food
      
        Cooking healthy food is hard and confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it.
        Cooking healthy food will take too much time
        Cooking healthy food is expensive. It’s not worth it.
        I will not be able to buy healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know how to cook healthy.
      
      Next thing they must do: Eating healthy food
      1)  Etc...
      Next thing they must do: Exercise Regularly
      1)  Etc...”

Now we’re gonna go full circle here. Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each aligns with the four value drivers as well.

(DREAM OUTCOME * PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVEMENT)/(TIME DELAY * EFFORT AND SACRIFICE) = VALUE


Dream Outcome→ This will not be financially worth it
        Likelihood of Achievement→ It won’t work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way. (This is the most unique and service-specific of the problem buckets).
        Effort & Sacrifice→ This will be too hard, confusing. I won’t like it. I will suck at it.
        Time→ This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won’t be convenient for me.
      
      Now, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don’t let these buckets, which are just meant to get your brain going, constrain you. If it’s easier for you, just list out everything you can possibly think of.

What I showed here isn’t just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So 32 to 64 problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve.

So, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it, or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide).
      Now we get to the fun part: turning problems into solutions.

      Step #3: Solutions List
      Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone’s way, it’s time to define our solutions and list them out.
    
  Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. That’s it. So let’s take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we’re going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, “What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?” Then we are going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting 101. It’s beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding “how to” then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start. For our purposes, we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to have to do for our prospects and what we are going to solve for them.
      Once we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems (create value) in the next step. And I want to be 100 percent clear. You will solve every problem. We’ll explore how together, in the next step.

# PROBLEM→ SOLUTION
      PROBLEM: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping is hard, confusing, I won’t like it. I will suck at it→ How to make buying healthy food easy and enjoyable, so that anyone can do it (especially busy moms!)
        . . . takes too much time→ How to buy healthy food quickly
        . . . is expensive→ How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill
        . . . is unsustainable→ How to make buying healthy food take less effort than buying unhealthy food
        . . . is not my priority. My family’s needs will get in my way→ How to buy healthy food for you and your family at the same time
        . . . is undoable if I travel; I won’t know what to get→ How to get healthy food when traveling”

## PROBLEM: Cooking healthy food      
        . . . is hard, confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it→ How anyone can enjoy cooking healthy meals easily
        . . . will take too much time→ How to cook meals in under 5 minutes
        . . . is expensive, it’s not worth it→ How eating healthy is actually cheaper than unhealthy food
        . . . is unsustainable → How to make eating healthy last forever
        . . . is not my priority, my family’s needs will get in my way→ How to cook this despite your families concerns
        . . . is undoable if I travel I won’t know how to cook healthy→ How to travel and still cook healthy. 

## PROBLEM: Eating healthy food

. . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it→ How to eat delicious healthy food, without following complicated systems
        . . . etc
      
      
## PROBLEM: Exercise Regularly
     
        . . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it, and I will suck at it → Easy to follow exercise system that everyone enjoys
        ….etc.
      
     
Okay, whew. That’s a lot of problems (and a lot of intuited solutions courtesy of divergent thinking). You’ll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive. That’s totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy. So don’t limit yourself here.
      Brooke Castillo is a friend who runs an enormous life coaching business. To give you a different take on the problems-solutions list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam Offer for a 90-Day Relationship course. Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens. The main takeaway, though: Don’t be fancy. Just get all the problems down then turn them into solutions.
Regardless of whether the offer you’re creating is around fitness (like the example), a relationship course (like Brooke), or something wildly different (like ear aches), we now know what we need to do. Step four is the how (and how to do it without breaking the bank).
