*** Enhancing The Offer: Guarantees *** 

“You’re gonna like the way you look...I guarantee it.”

Men’s Warehouse ad that ran forever.

The single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is...drum roll...risk. Risk that it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do for them. Therefore, reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive. You will want to spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it. That being said, how much more attractive can a guarantee make an offer?

Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing the quality of the guarantee. It’s that important.

From an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees:

Unconditional
Conditional
Anti-Guarantee
Implied Guarantees.


You must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.

But won’t people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?

Sometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and your refund percentage doubles from 5 percent to 10 percent, you’ve still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that all goes to the bottom line.

Ex: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales
Guarantee Offer 130 sales, 13 refunds (10%)= 117 Net sales
117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)

Don't be emotional, just do the math. For a guarantee to not be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100 percent offset by people who refunded. So an absolute increase in sales of 5 percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in refunds of 5 percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely). So, for the most part, the stronger the guarantee, the higher the net increase in total purchases, even if the refund rate increases alongside it.

Warning: While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy because of guarantees can become very shitty customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success with your product or service. In a world where you want to reverse risk and get customers the best outcome possible, tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties.

*Pro Tip: High Cost Services Warning*

If you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI guarantee, as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling.

**Types of Guarantees**

What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.

To give a guarantee teeth you have to decide what you’ll do if they don’t get the result.

Without the “or what” portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted.

Note: This is what most marketers do.

Bad Example: We will get you 20 clients guaranteed.

Better example: You will get 20 clients in your first 30 days, or we give you your money back + your advertising dollars spent with us. This is a simple, but strong guarantee.

Here are the four types of guarantees. I’ll go over them in theory then we will apply them.

1) Unconditional Guarantees

As I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and “anti-” guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees. They're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you will have some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.

2) Conditional Guarantees

Conditional guarantees include “terms and conditions” to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on. In general, you want these to be “better than money back” guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a very powerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those part of the conditional guarantee. In a perfect world, 100% of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but will have achieved their result, and therefore will not want to take it. That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just fyi - if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the outcome.

3) Anti-Guarantees

Anti-guarantees are when you explicitly state “all sales are final.” You will want to own this position. You must come up with a creative “reason why” the sales are final. Typically, you’ll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your part that a consumer could immediately understand and think “Yes, that makes sense.” These types of guarantees are especially important with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.

4) Implied Guarantees

Implied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare, profitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I don’t get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of “If I do a great job, I will be very well compensated.” These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that you will get compensated when you do perform.

**Stacking Guarantees**

An experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees. For example, you could give an unconditional 30 day no questions asked guarantee then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back 90 day guarantee. That would be an example of stacking an unconditional with a conditional guarantee.

You can also stack two conditional guarantees around different (or sequential) outcomes. For example, you’ll make $10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1, 2, and 3. This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for achievement). Doing this shows the prospect you are serious about getting them results and convinced that they will achieve what they want. This shifts the burden of risk back from them onto us...a very powerful strategy.

Let’s go through some different guarantee examples:

Guarantee: If you don’t achieve X, in Y time, we will [insert offer] . . .


**[Unconditional] “No Questions Asked” Refund Guarantee**

What the Client Gets: A) a full refund, B) a 50 percent refund, C) a refund of their ad spend and any ancillary costs incurred, D) you pay for a competitors program instead, E) you return their money plus an additional $1,000 (or other applicable amount)

My Take: This is about as simple as it gets. It’s also very risky. You put yourself in a situation where if someone does not achieve the results, whether because of your fault or not, you will still be held accountable. Obviously this is a strong, but unoriginal guarantee. You can add conditions, but the more conditions you add, the faster this guarantee loses its teeth.

Wording: I heard Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, pitch his unconditional guarantee on a webinar and I thought it was unbelievable. These are 100% his words and not my own. I take no credit for this but have included it for completeness.

“I’m not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that’s when you decide to keep it. If it’s not for you, no hard feelings. You will then, after signing up at URL be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn’t for you. But you can’t make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it. And know this...whether it’s 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain’t happy, I ain’t happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you’re happy. All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell use “gimme my money” and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support request average 61min over a 24/7 time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up at URL you’re getting exactly what you need to BENEFIT.”

Pro Tip: Name Your Guarantee Something Cool

If you are going to give a guarantee, spice it up. Instead of using “satisfaction” or some other “vanilla” word, describe it more strongly.

Generic Example (Bad): 30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee.

Creative Imagery Example #1 (Good): In 30 days, if you wouldn’t jump into shark infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you paid.

Creative Imagery Example #2 (Great): You’ll get our famous “Club a Baby Seal Guarantee”After 30 days of using our services, if you wouldn’t club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don’t have to pay a penny.

**[Unconditional] Satisfaction-Based Refund Guarantee (Expanded from above):**

What the Client Gets: If at any time they're not satisfied with the level of service they're receiving from you, they can request a refund (at any time) for the program.

My Take: Believe it or not, this was my guarantee when I sold weight-loss programs. Besides being an irresistible offer, I guaranteed satisfaction. I used the strength of my guarantee to close a lot of deals. “Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you’re going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I’ll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.”

It works perfectly with a best-case/worst-case close. “Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today.” If you are good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge. That line made me a lot of money. I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years.

Satisfaction/No questions asked is the highest form of guarantee. It means we could do everything right and you could still ask for your money back. As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and faster closing on the sales side. But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises. If not, steer clear. I believe this offer works much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of fulfillment.

Pro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type

Bigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B2C businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time). The higher the ticket, and the more business oriented it is, the more you want to steer towards specific guarantees. That may or may not include refunds, and may or may not have conditions.

**[Conditional] Outsized Refund Guarantee**

What the Client Gets: Double or Triple their money back, or a no-strings-attached payment of $X,XXX (or another amount that’s far more than what they paid).

My Take: This is for when you sell something with high margins. And this is a guarantee to add with a consumption condition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world class affiliate marketer Jason Fladlien (who did $27M in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said “if you buy this course and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000 no questions asked.” He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a $2997 course. What’s more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales. That’s what a crazy guarantee does for you.

In general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need a lot of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there’s a low chance of the result not being achieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform a traditional 30-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).
