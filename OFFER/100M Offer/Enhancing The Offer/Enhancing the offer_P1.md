**Enhancing The Offer: Scarcity, Urgency, Bonuses, Guarantees, and Naming**


“But wait . . . there’s more, if you order today . . . ”

Every infomercial in the 90s


May 2019. Arnold Scwarzenegger’s home.

After School All Stars Fundraiser. The line of cars outside Arnold’s house was around the corner . . . and we were in one of them. We were sitting in our Uber when a security guard with an earpiece, black suit, and black sunglasses knocked on the driver’s window. It was like straight out of a movie.

The driver rolled down the window. “Name?” “Alex and Leila Hormozi.”

He scanned the list on his clipboard, nodded, then checked off our names. “Great,” he said. His demeanor transformed from stern to inviting. “Welcome to the fundraiser. Stay in this line. You’ll make a left, then security will escort you the rest of the way.”

The security guard talked into his walkie talkie to the next post down the road, signaling our car was approved.

Pulling up to the front of the estate was like entering into a Bond movie. Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Ferraris, and brands of cars that are too expensive to even speak of. Old guys with young, scantily-clad girls. A-List Actors. Celebrities with millions of followers who were recording themselves as they arrived, talking through their iphones to their audiences. And us.

The fundraiser was $25,000 per ticket to attend, with an invite list of only 100. There was a red carpet and all. Every year, the fundraiser culminated in a big auction for memorabilia and items some of the business owners in the audience gave away for charity.

We walked around looking at the entertainment stations purposely devised to get donors in the “giving mood.” We saw $10,000 scotches . . . $500 cigars . . . pre-released items from major brands that wouldn’t be available to the public until months later. And, of course, the most expensive cuisine you could imagine. Leila and I were just soaking it all in. It was a wonderful night. We definitely felt like cool kids.

Ben, the CEO of the charity, saw us looking lost and walked over. He took me by the arm to introduce me to some of the other donors. These were all men who were older than me and donating $100,000 and up without a second thought.

The man he introduced me to was one of the charity’s biggest donors. He had built an ultra-high end jewelry and watch business. I’m talking $100,000, $500,000, $2,000,000+ rare status symbols that people buy only so other .001 percenters know they belong. He had donated upwards of $700,000 in merchandise as prizes for the fundraiser that evening.

“Alex and Leila, meet George,” Ben said. “He’s been very generous with his time and money to the cause. George, this is Alex and Leila Hormozi. They’re donating $1,000,000 tonight to ASAS. I figured you are both good people and wanted to connect you two.”

“Nice to meet you both,” George said with calm, weathered eyes. He was in his late sixties, tall and sturdily built. You could hear his eastern block origins in his accent. He sounded like a man who had fought tooth and nail to be here, but had softened his demeanor for gatherings such as these. But the tiger with teeth and claws remained under the surface, ready to be called upon at a moment’s notice. I felt like I understood this guy.

Ben broke the ice. “So….George was the one who got me to raise the price from $15,000 per ticket to $25,000. We had more demand than ever this year. But I took his advice. I cut the amount of tickets we sold and raised the prices.”

“That’s right,” said George, content that his sage business advice had been followed.

“When demand increases, cut supply.” He perked up slightly as we talked about money.

This man had built his business from nothing and had found ways to sell things for extraordinary profits by understanding human psychology. I had long learned about supply and demand, but this guy was using its psychological underpinnings to fuel a fundraising. You could take the tiger out of the jungle, but not the jungle out of the tiger.

People want what they can’t have. People want what other people want. People want things only a select few have access to. He was dead right. They had raised an extra one million dollars that night before the event had even started by cutting the supply of tickets and raising the prices. On top of that, all the people were more qualified than ever to be big donors. The night ended up being the most successful night in the charity’s history, raising nearly $5,400,000 from only 100 people (that’s $54,000 per head!). Each of the items was auctioned off as a one-of-a-kind item. And if you missed it, you would never have a chance again to buy it. Arnold even threw in some bonuses when two people would get high enough in the bidding, allowing the charity to get both donations.

It was a masterful display of human psychology at work in a setting where people were knowingly over-paying for products. The products remained unchanged, yet within this setting, an item that wouldn’t sell at a different venue for $10,000 sold for $100,000. That’s how powerful scarcity, urgency, and bonuses are. And breaking down how to use them to further increase demand for your offer, without changing your offer, is the purpose of this section.

*Author Note - Other Persuasion Powers At Play*

Scarcity, urgency, bonuses, and guarantees were not the only persuasion tools being employed to get egregious prices at the fundraiser. They also used commitment and consistency, status, peer pressure, goodwill, celebrity endorsements, competition, etc. However, scarcity, urgency, and bonuses are the only three I will be breaking down in this book as I believe they belong more with the “offer” and less with the actual “selling,” which I will talk about in depth in Acquisition: Volume IV $100M Sales.

**The Delicate Dance of Desire**

Fundamentally, all marketing exists to influence the supply and demand curve. We artificially increase the demand for our products and services through some sort of persuasive communication. When we increase the demand, we can sell more units. When we decrease supply, we can sell those units for more money. The “perfect profit combination” is lots of demand, and very little supply, or perceived supply. The process of enhancing your core offer is designed to do both of these things: increase demand and decrease perceived supply so that you can sell the same products for more money than you otherwise could, and in higher volumes than you otherwise would (over a longer time horizon).

*Author Note:*

This assumes a regular business who is not trying to gain mass market penetration for some other strategic advantage.
Desire comes from not getting what you want. In fact, I heard this quote that I love from Naval Ravikant: “Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” It follows, therefore, that we only want things we do not have. As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears. Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or desire), we must decrease or delay satisfying the desires of our prospects. We must sell fewer units than we otherwise can. Let that sit with you for a second.

Consider this example. We promote some two-day workshop that is upcoming. First we whisper that it’s coming. Then we tease it with some of the benefits. Then we shout that it is launching in a week. Then, when we launch this amazing workshop. We have two supply-demand scenarios:

Scenario one: We sell 10 units at $500 each (sell entire pyramid at price all say yes)

Scenario two: We sell two one-day workshops 1-on-1 for $5000 each. (skim top of pyramid, with 80 percent not purchasing)

It’s worth noting that each of these prospects have a different buying threshold. In my experience, demand for services is non-linear. Instead, I’ve found demand to be fractal (80/20). In other words, one fifth of the prospects are willing to pay five times the price (or more).

In the example, I might have ten people willing to pay $500, but two of them willing to pay $5000. So, I would make more, have lower costs (more profits), provide more value, and increase the demand in the remaining prospect base by selling fewer units. Think about how exclusive scenario one vs scenario two would feel. Think about all the people who would want to purchase, but would not be able to. Would this increase or decrease their desire? It would increase it, of course.

On top of that, if people see that others who ‘were able to get in’ are loving it, it would further increase their desire. And the next time, they would act with more urgency, and be willing to pay more for the same thing than they originally did. So now, in the aftermath of our second scenario, we still have eight people who have unsatisfied desire. This increases their desire further. And to boot, we now have new prospects who weren't in the original pool who now want what we have.

The next time we promote scenario two, we then open three spots at the same price and sell them all (still leaving some prospects with pent up demand!). This is a continuous theme.

Conversely, if we were to promote scenario one again (the $500 price point), we would probably sell fewer slots the second time around. Why? We have no pent up demand. All desire has been satisfied. When you “pull the trigger too early,” each successive instance we promote, we sell even fewer. Eventually, we run out of sufficient demand to make even a single sale. This is the sad state many businesses find themselves in always trying to generate more demand to make another quick sale.

Hormozi Law: The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. “The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off.”

We must endeavor to keep our supply (and satisfaction of desire) under the demand that we are able to generate. This maximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base. This is the real key to never going hungry.

Summary Points

The reason I titled this sub-section “Delicate Dance of Desire” is that supply and demand are inversely correlated (in theory). If you satisfy zero desire (provide zero supply), you will not make money, and eventually leave people feeling rejected (Note: it takes much longer than you think).

Conversely, if you satisfy all the demand, you will kill your golden goose, and not know where your next meal will come from. Mastering supply and demand comes from the elegant dance between the two. If you sleep with your significant other everyday they have less desire than if you haven’t slept with them for a week. We want the ravenous prospect, not merely the aroused.

Therefore, understanding the interplay between these variables is key to enhancing your offer and the amount of profits you will make over time. Up to this point, we have covered all the things inside of your offer that can make it immune to price comparison and transform regular services and products into things that people will find a way to pay for. It would follow that the next variable that can make your offer more desirable is how it is presented. In other words, the outside variables that position the product in your prospect’s mind. These forces are often more powerful than your core offer. In this next section Enhancing Your Offer, I will show you how I:

Use scarcity to decrease supply to raise prices (and indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness)

Use urgency to increase demand by decreasing the action threshold of a prospect.

Use bonuses to increase demand (and increase perceived exclusivity).

Use guarantees to increase demand by reversing risk.

Use names to re-stimulate demand and expand awareness of my offer to my target audience.

I will define each, then give you examples of how to use them. We will use all these variables to enhance our offer and shift the demand curve in our favor, leaving our customers always wanting for more. We will start by tactically stimulating “fear of missing out” aka FOMO through scarcity.
