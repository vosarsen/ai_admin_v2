## üìù Technical Debt

1. **Database**
   - Missing foreign key constraints
   - No cascade delete rules
   - Incomplete migration scripts

2. **Code**
   - Some services exceed 500 lines
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - Mixed async/callback patterns

3. **Testing**
   - Low test coverage (~40%)
   - Missing integration tests
   - No performance tests

4. **Documentation**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Missing deployment guide
   - No troubleshooting guide

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - High latency to Supabase from Russia (150-200ms)
   - Context loading can be slow for busy salons
   - No connection pooling

2. **Configuration**
   - Redis port hardcoded with temporary hacks (6380 ‚Üí 6379)
   - Need separate configs for local vs production

3. **Reliability**
   - WhatsApp session can expire
   - No automatic reconnection
   - Queue can get stuck on errors

4. **UX**
   - Error messages not user-friendly
   - No typing indicators
   - Limited formatting options
   - Prices not showing correctly (format issues)

## üìä Metrics to Track

- Average response time
- Daily active users
- Booking conversion rate
- Error rate by type
- Cache hit ratio
- Worker memory usage
