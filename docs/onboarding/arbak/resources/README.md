# Resources - For Future Reference

These guides are for **transferring the infrastructure to OTHER projects**, not for learning the system in ai_admin_v2.

If you're just starting with ai_admin_v2, go back to the main README.md.

## Contents

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `integration-guide.md` | Complete 30-page guide for setting up .claude/ in a new project | Copying infrastructure to another codebase |
| `quick-start-guide.md` | 15-minute minimal setup for new projects | Fast setup without deep understanding |
| `customization-checklist.md` | Step-by-step customization tasks | After copying .claude/ to new project |
| `package-overview.md` | What's included in the .claude/ folder | Understanding the package contents |
| `transfer-instructions.md` | How to package and transfer infrastructure | Preparing to move to another project |

## Quick Guide: Transferring to Another Project

**When you want to copy this infrastructure to Arbak's OTHER projects:**

1. Read `quick-start-guide.md` (15 min) - Get the basics
2. Follow `transfer-instructions.md` - Copy files
3. Work through `customization-checklist.md` - Adapt to new project (2-4 hours)
4. Refer to `integration-guide.md` as needed - Deep dive on any topic

**Note:** You don't need these NOW. Focus on learning the system first in ai_admin_v2!
