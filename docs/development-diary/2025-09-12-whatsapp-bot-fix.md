# WhatsApp Bot Response Fix - September 12, 2025

## Problem
WhatsApp bot was not responding to messages, even though it was receiving and processing them.

## Symptoms
- Bot received WhatsApp messages ✅
- AI processed messages and generated responses ✅
- Bot responses were NOT delivered to users ❌
- Error in logs: `Failed to send message via API: Request failed with status code 500`

## Root Cause
The WhatsApp API client was using the wrong endpoint to send messages:
- **Incorrect endpoint**: `/webhook/whatsapp/baileys/send` (doesn't exist → 500 error)
- **Correct endpoint**: `/api/whatsapp/sessions/{companyId}/send`

## Investigation Process
1. Checked PM2 processes - all running ✅
2. Checked WhatsApp connection - healthy ✅
3. Checked worker logs - messages being processed ✅
4. Found 500 errors when sending responses
5. Tested direct API call - worked with correct endpoint ✅
6. Found incorrect endpoint in `api-client.js`

## Solution
Changed one line in `/src/integrations/whatsapp/api-client.js`:

```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const response = await axios.post(
  `${this.apiUrl}/webhook/whatsapp/baileys/send`,
  
// After (correct):
const response = await axios.post(
  `${this.apiUrl}/api/whatsapp/sessions/${companyId}/send`,
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/integrations/whatsapp/api-client.js` - Fixed API endpoint

## Test Results
After fix:
- Bot receives message: "Привет! Какие есть свободные слоты на сегодня?"
- AI processes in ~14 seconds
- Bot successfully sends response: "На сегодня свободное время есть: 18:00, 19:00, 19:30. На какое время вас записать?"
- ✅ Full cycle working

## Additional Issues Found (Not Fixed)
1. **Phone number extraction for media messages** - Some WhatsApp media messages have empty phone numbers
2. **Company ID validation** - Sometimes passed as object instead of string

## Performance Metrics
- Message processing time: ~14 seconds total
  - AI processing: ~10-12 seconds
  - Context loading: 5ms (cached) / 430ms (cold)
  - Message sending: ~1 second

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify API endpoints exist before using them
2. Test message sending directly when debugging delivery issues
3. Worker logs clearly show HTTP status codes which help identify endpoint issues

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Bot is fully functional and responding to messages
