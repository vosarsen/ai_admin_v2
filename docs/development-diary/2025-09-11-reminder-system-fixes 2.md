# Reminder System Fixes - September 11, 2025

## Problem
The reminder system was not sending notifications to clients:
- Evening reminders (day before appointment) were not sent
- 2-hour reminders on appointment day were not sent
- Reminder worker was running but processing 0 reminders

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Database Field Mismatches
- Code was looking for `appointment_datetime` field, but database has `datetime`
- Code was filtering by `status = 'pending'`, but all bookings have `status = 'active'`
- Code was using `user_id + '@c.us'` for phone, but database has `client_phone` field
- Code referenced `booking.record_id`, but database has `yclients_record_id`

### 2. Missing Scheduler
- Reminder worker only listened to the queue but nothing was adding tasks to it
- No periodic check for bookings that need reminders
- `scheduleRemindersForExistingBookings()` was never called

### 3. Missing sendReminder Method
- The `sendReminder` method was not implemented in the reminder service
- Worker was trying to call non-existent method

### 4. Static Template Issue
- Initially implemented static reminder format
- Should use randomized templates from `templates.js` for more natural messages

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Field References
```javascript
// Before
.gte('appointment_datetime', tomorrow.toISOString())
.eq('status', 'pending')
booking.user_id + '@c.us'
booking.record_id

// After
.gte('datetime', tomorrow.toISOString())
.eq('status', 'active')
booking.client_phone
booking.yclients_record_id
```

### 2. Added Periodic Scheduling
```javascript
// Added to index-reminder.js
// Schedule reminders on startup
reminderService.scheduleRemindersForExistingBookings()

// Check every 30 minutes for new bookings
setInterval(() => {
  reminderService.scheduleRemindersForExistingBookings()
}, 30 * 60 * 1000);
```

### 3. Implemented sendReminder Method
- Added complete `sendReminder` method with WhatsApp integration
- Integrated with randomized templates system
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 4. Integrated Template System
- Used existing `templates.js` with randomized greetings and endings
- Different templates for day-before vs 2-hour reminders
- Natural language variations to avoid seeming automated

## Fixed Files
1. `/src/services/reminder/index.js` - Fixed all database fields and added sendReminder
2. `/src/workers/index-reminder.js` - Added periodic scheduling
3. `/src/workers/reminder-worker-v2.js` - Updated to pass reminder type
4. `/src/sync/bookings-sync.js` - Fixed missing BOOKINGS_BATCH_SIZE constant

## Test Results
After deployment:
- ✅ Found 4 upcoming bookings
- ✅ Scheduled 8 reminders (day-before and 2-hour for each)
- ✅ Jobs successfully added to BullMQ queue
- ✅ Random templates working correctly
- ✅ No errors in reminder worker logs

## Reminder Schedule
- **Day before**: Random time between 19:00-21:00
- **2 hours before**: Exactly 2 hours before appointment
- **Check interval**: Every 30 minutes for new bookings

## Next Steps
- Monitor actual reminder delivery when scheduled times arrive
- Verify WhatsApp messages are sent correctly
- Check that reminders are marked as sent in database
- Consider adding more template variations if needed
