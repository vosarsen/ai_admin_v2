# WhatsApp Protection System Implementation

**Date**: September 19, 2025
**Author**: Development Team
**Context**: Following critical incident where auto-recovery deleted creds.json requiring QR rescan
**Impact**: Complete prevention of accidental data loss and QR rescans

## 🔴 Critical Incident Analysis

### What Happened (September 18, 19:20 MSK)

1. **16:11** - WhatsApp disconnected (likely network issue)
2. **16:16** - After 5 minutes, `whatsapp-auto-recovery.js` triggered `recover()`
3. **16:16** - `recover()` executed `rm -rf /opt/ai-admin/baileys_sessions/company_962302/*`
4. **16:16** - **ALL FILES DELETED** including `creds.json`
5. **16:17-16:20** - Multiple recovery attempts failed, sending alerts
6. **Result**: Complete data loss, QR rescan required, service downtime

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Cause: Dangerous Recovery Logic
```javascript
// OLD DANGEROUS CODE
async recover() {
    await this.cleanupAuth(); // This did rm -rf /* !!!
    await this.restartAPI();
    await this.initializeSession();
    // Required QR scan
}

async cleanupAuth() {
    await execAsync(`rm -rf ${CONFIG.authPath}/*`); // DELETED EVERYTHING!
}
```

#### Contributing Factors:

1. **Too Short Timeout** - 5 minutes is not enough for network issues
2. **No Backup System** - No way to recover deleted creds.json
3. **Race Conditions** - Multiple monitors fighting each other
4. **No Network Detection** - Treated network outages as WhatsApp issues
5. **Hardcoded Companies** - System only worked for company_962302

## 🛡️ Protection System Implemented

### 1. Smart Recovery Logic
**Before**: Deleted everything after 5 minutes
**After**:
- Try reconnection WITHOUT cleanup first
- Smart cleanup preserves creds.json
- Full cleanup only at 200+ files (last resort)
- 15-minute timeout (was 5 minutes)

```javascript
// NEW SAFE CODE
async recover() {
    // Try to reconnect first WITHOUT cleanup
    const reconnected = await this.initializeSession();
    if (reconnected) return true;

    // Only cleanup if files > 150 (smart cleanup, preserves creds.json)
    if (fileCount > 150) {
        await this.cleanupAuth(); // Smart cleanup, NOT rm -rf
    }

    // Full cleanup only in emergency (200+ files)
    if (fileCount > 200) {
        await this.fullCleanupAuth(); // Only as last resort
    }
}
```

### 2. Backup System

Created `whatsapp-backup-manager.js`:
- Automatic backup before ANY cleanup
- Keeps last 5 backups per company
- Can restore from backup
- Preserves critical files (creds.json, app-state-sync)

```bash
# Create backup
node scripts/whatsapp-backup-manager.js backup 962302

# Restore from backup
node scripts/whatsapp-backup-manager.js restore 962302

# List backups
node scripts/whatsapp-backup-manager.js list 962302
```

### 3. Network Failure Detection

System now detects network vs WhatsApp issues:
- Pings Google DNS to check connectivity
- Skips recovery during network outages
- Different handling for network errors

```javascript
if (status.networkError) {
    const hasInternet = await this.checkNetworkConnectivity();
    if (!hasInternet) {
        console.log('🌐 No internet - skipping recovery');
        return; // Don't recover during network outage
    }
}
```

### 4. Monitor Coordination

Prevents race conditions between monitors:
- Flag files signal cleanup in progress
- auto-recovery skips checks during cleanup
- Prevents conflicting operations

```javascript
// Check if cleanup in progress
const flagFile = `/tmp/whatsapp-cleanup-${companyId}.flag`;
if (await fs.pathExists(flagFile)) {
    console.log('🧹 Cleanup in progress, skipping...');
    return;
}
```

### 5. Multi-Tenant Support

Fixed hardcoded company IDs:
- Dynamic company detection
- Per-company configurations
- Parallel processing for multiple companies
- Individual thresholds per salon

### 6. Health Check Dashboard

Created `whatsapp-health-check.js`:
```
📊 WhatsApp Health Check Dashboard

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage

### Emergency Recovery Procedure:
```bash
# 1. Check health
node scripts/whatsapp-health-check.js

# 2. If creds.json missing, check backups
node scripts/whatsapp-backup-manager.js list 962302

# 3. Restore from backup
node scripts/whatsapp-backup-manager.js restore 962302

# 4. Restart services
pm2 restart ai-admin-api whatsapp-monitor
```

### Daily Operations:
```bash
# Morning check
node scripts/whatsapp-health-check.js

# Create manual backup
node scripts/whatsapp-backup-manager.js backup-all

# Monitor live
node scripts/whatsapp-health-check.js --watch
```

### Automated Services:
```bash
# Start monitors
pm2 start scripts/whatsapp-auto-recovery.js --name whatsapp-monitor
pm2 start scripts/whatsapp-multi-company-monitor.js --name whatsapp-multi-monitor

# Optional: Auto cleanup (use with caution)
pm2 start scripts/whatsapp-auto-cleanup-manager.js --name whatsapp-auto-cleanup
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Critical Insights:
1. **NEVER use `rm -rf` in production** - Always preserve critical files
2. **Timeout matters** - Network issues need 10-15 minutes to recover
3. **Backup before cleanup** - Always have rollback option
4. **Coordinate monitors** - Prevent race conditions
5. **Test recovery paths** - Ensure they don't cause more damage

### Best Practices Established:
1. Progressive thresholds (120→150→180→200)
2. Try reconnection before cleanup
3. Network detection before recovery
4. Flag files for coordination
5. Automatic backups
6. Health dashboards

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Short Term:
- [ ] Backup to S3/cloud storage
- [ ] Slack notifications alongside Telegram
- [ ] Auto-restore from backup on failure

### Long Term:
- [ ] Predictive cleanup (ML-based)
- [ ] Distributed monitoring (multiple servers)
- [ ] GraphQL API for monitoring
- [ ] Mobile app for monitoring
