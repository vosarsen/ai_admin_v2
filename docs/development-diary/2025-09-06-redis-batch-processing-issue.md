# Redis Batch Processing Issue Analysis
**Date**: September 6, 2025  
**Author**: AI Admin Development Team  
**Status**: ⚠️ Issue Identified, Solution Pending

## Context
After implementing Baileys WhatsApp integration and fixing Supabase imports, the bot still doesn't respond to messages. Investigation revealed that while messages are being received and stored in Redis, they are not being processed by the batch processor.

## Problem Analysis

### Symptoms
1. Messages are received via webhook and added to Redis with key `rapid-fire:79686484488`
2. API server logs confirm: "Found rapid-fire keys: 1, keys: rapid-fire:79686484488"
3. Batch processor logs show: "No pending batches found"
4. Worker starts successfully after fixing missing npm packages
5. No bot responses are sent back to users

### Root Cause
The batch processor cannot find the `rapid-fire:*` keys that the API server creates. This indicates a Redis database/connection mismatch between services.

### Evidence from Logs

#### API Server (Working)
```
2025-09-06 19:13:41: RPUSH executed for key: rapid-fire:79686484488, data length: 169
2025-09-06 19:13:41: Found rapid-fire keys: 1, keys: rapid-fire:79686484488
2025-09-06 19:13:41: Batch content length: 1
```

#### Batch Processor (Not Finding Keys)
```
2025-09-06 19:14:06: Searching for batch keys with pattern: rapid-fire:*
2025-09-06 19:14:06: Total keys in DB: 292, sample: bull:company-962302-messages:2244, ...
2025-09-06 19:14:06: No pending batches found
```

## Missing Dependencies Fixed
During investigation, several missing npm packages were identified and installed:
- `bottleneck` - Rate limiting library
- `prom-client` - Prometheus metrics (not actually used, can be removed)
- `date-fns-tz` - Timezone handling for date operations

## Current State
1. ✅ Baileys WhatsApp connection established
2. ✅ Messages received and stored in Redis
3. ✅ Worker process running without errors
4. ❌ Batch processor not finding messages
5. ❌ Messages not being processed
6. ❌ No bot responses sent

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Redis Database Selection Issue
Different services might be using different Redis databases (0-15). Need to ensure all services use the same database.

### 2. Redis Connection Configuration
Check if services are connecting to different Redis instances or using different connection parameters.

### 3. Key Expiration
Keys might be expiring before batch processor can find them (TTL is set to 600 seconds).

## Next Steps
1. Verify Redis connection strings in all services
2. Check Redis database selection (SELECT command)
3. Ensure consistent Redis client configuration
4. Test direct Redis operations from batch processor
5. Consider implementing immediate processing instead of batching for testing

## Files to Check
- `/src/services/redis-batch-service.js` - Batch service Redis client
- `/src/api/webhooks/whatsapp-batched.js` - Webhook Redis client
- `/src/config/redis.js` - Redis configuration
- `/src/database/redis-factory.js` - Redis client factory

## Temporary Workaround
Could implement direct message processing without batching:
1. Webhook receives message
2. Immediately adds to BullMQ queue
3. Worker processes without batch delay

## Lessons Learned
1. **Dependency Management**: Need to ensure all npm packages are properly listed in package.json
2. **Redis Consistency**: All services must use identical Redis configuration
3. **Monitoring**: Need better monitoring to detect when components are not communicating
4. **Testing**: Integration tests should verify end-to-end message flow
