## Fixed: SEARCH_SLOTS Without Service Specification

### Problem
Client asked "На воскресенье какое есть свободное время?" and bot responded "все время занято" even though there were available slots.

**Root cause:** SEARCH_SLOTS command failed when no service was specified.

### Solution
Implemented intelligent service detection based on client history:
- If client has favorite service (≥50% of visits) → use it automatically
- Otherwise → ask for clarification with top 3 suggestions

### Changes
- Modified `command-handler.js` to analyze service history
- Updated `two-stage-response-prompt.js` to handle requiresServiceSelection flag
- Test phone: 89686484488 (added to CLAUDE.md)

## Fixed: Universal Prompts System

### Problem
Hardcoded business-specific terms throughout prompts:
- "барбершоп", "мастер", specific services

### Solution
Made all prompts business-agnostic:
- Removed all hardcoded terms
- Removed word "мастер" everywhere
- Implemented proper Russian declensions
- Now pulls everything from context

### Files Modified
- `two-stage-response-prompt.js` - removed hardcode, added declension rules
- `two-stage-command-prompt.js` - made validation generic
- `improved-prompt-v2.js` - updated to use "сотрудник"

### Documentation Created
- `docs/SEARCH_SLOTS_IMPROVEMENT.md`
- `docs/UNIVERSAL_PROMPTS.md`

### Status
✅ Both issues fixed and tested successfully
