# GitHub Token Update - September 12, 2025

## Issue
GitHub Personal Access Token "AI Admin MVP" was expiring in 7 days (September 19, 2025).

## Action Taken
Generated new token with extended expiration date.

### Token Configuration
- **Name**: AI Admin MVP
- **Expiration**: December 25, 2025 (90+ days)
- **Scopes**: 
  - ✅ `repo` - Full control of private repositories
  - ✅ `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows

### Update Process
1. Regenerated token via GitHub Settings
2. Updated local git credentials
3. Tested with push/pull operations
4. Confirmed working status

### Security Notes
- Token stored in `~/.git-credentials` for automated operations
- Uses `credential.helper=store` for persistence
- Token has minimal required permissions (principle of least privilege)

## Important Reminders
- **Next expiration**: December 25, 2025
- **Reminder expected**: ~December 18, 2025 (7 days before)
- **Never commit tokens to repository**
- **Never share tokens in public channels**

## Testing
Successfully tested with:
- `git push` operations
- `git pull` operations
- All automated deployments working correctly

## Files Modified
- `~/.git-credentials` - Updated with new token (local only, not in repo)

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - New token active and working until December 25, 2025
