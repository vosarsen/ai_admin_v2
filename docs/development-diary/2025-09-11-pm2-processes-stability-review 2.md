# PM2 Processes Stability Review After Baileys Migration

**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Context**: Review of PM2 processes stability after WhatsApp Baileys migration  
**Author**: Development Team

## Background

After migrating from Venom-bot to Baileys for WhatsApp integration, we noticed high restart counts in PM2 processes. This review was conducted to assess the actual stability of the system.

## Initial Status (Before Reset)

| Process | Restarts | Status | Issue |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| ai-admin-api | 12 | Stable | Normal maintenance restarts |
| ai-admin-batch-processor | 0 | Stable | No issues |
| ai-admin-booking-monitor | 225+ | Unstable | CircuitBreaker error (not Baileys-related) |
| ai-admin-reminder | 15 | Stable | Normal maintenance restarts |
| ai-admin-worker-v2 | 156+ | Unstable | Baileys connection timeouts |

## Issues Found

### 1. ai-admin-booking-monitor (225+ restarts)
- **Error**: `TypeError: this._registerMonitor is not a function`
- **Location**: `/opt/ai-admin/src/utils/circuit-breaker.js:50`
- **Cause**: Code issue in CircuitBreaker initialization
- **Impact**: Process crashes but recovers automatically
- **Status**: Despite errors, the service was functioning (checking YClients every minute)

### 2. ai-admin-worker-v2 (156+ restarts)
- **Error**: Baileys timeout errors in `uploadPreKeysToServerIfRequired`
- **Cause**: WhatsApp connection issues with Baileys library
- **Impact**: Message processing disrupted
- **Related errors**:
  - `Error: Timed Out` at baileys/lib/Utils/generics.js
  - `Connection Closed` with status 428 (Precondition Required)

### 3. ai-admin-reminder (Stable)
- No critical issues found
- Only warning about `MASTER_KEY` not set (development only)
- Processing 0 reminders (expected if no active reminders)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Reset PM2 Counters
```bash
pm2 reset all
```
This command reset all restart counters to 0, allowing fresh monitoring from current point.

### 2. Stability Monitoring
After reset, monitored for 2+ minutes:
- **Result**: All processes remained stable with 0 restarts
- All PIDs remained the same (no hidden restarts)
- Uptime continued to increase normally

## Current Status (After Reset)

| Process | Restarts | Uptime | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| ai-admin-api | 0 | 4h+ | ✅ Stable |
| ai-admin-batch-processor | 0 | 5h+ | ✅ Stable |
| ai-admin-booking-monitor | 0 | 11m+ | ✅ Stable |
| ai-admin-reminder | 0 | 17h+ | ✅ Stable |
| ai-admin-worker-v2 | 0 | 23m+ | ✅ Stable |

## Key Findings

1. **Historical restarts** were accumulated over time, not representing current stability
2. **ai-admin-booking-monitor** works despite initialization errors (self-recovering)
3. **ai-admin-worker-v2** had Baileys connection issues but seems stable now
4. **PM2 reset** is useful for establishing baseline for monitoring

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check `pm2 status` periodically to catch new issues early
2. **PM2 Reset**: Use `pm2 reset all` after fixing issues to get clean monitoring baseline
3. **Investigate Baileys**: If worker-v2 restarts recur, need to fix Baileys connection handling
4. **Fix CircuitBreaker**: Low priority - booking-monitor works despite the error

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check current status
pm2 status

# Reset restart counters
pm2 reset all

# Reset specific process
pm2 reset ai-admin-worker-v2

# View logs
pm2 logs [process-name] --lines 50

# Monitor in real-time
pm2 monit
```

## Lessons Learned

1. High restart counts don't always mean current instability - could be historical
2. Some processes can self-recover from errors (booking-monitor example)
3. PM2 reset is valuable for establishing monitoring baseline
4. Baileys migration requires careful monitoring of connection stability

## Next Steps

- Monitor processes over next 24 hours
- If worker-v2 restarts recur, investigate Baileys session management
- Consider implementing health checks for critical processes
- Document any new stability patterns
