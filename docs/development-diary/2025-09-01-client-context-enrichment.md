# Client Context Enrichment Implementation

## Date: September 1, 2025

## Context
After fixing the declension synchronization bug, we analyzed the client context system and identified several areas for improvement. The bot was storing staff IDs instead of names and wasn't tracking client preferences or visit patterns.

## Problem
1. Client context showed staff IDs (e.g., `2895125`) instead of names
2. No analysis of visit patterns or preferences
3. No support for "как обычно" (as usual) bookings
4. Missing service-staff pair tracking
5. No visit frequency calculation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Loader (`src/services/ai-admin-v2/modules/data-loader.js`)
Added methods to resolve IDs to names and analyze patterns:
- `getStaffNamesByIds()` - Maps staff IDs to names
- `getServiceNamesByIds()` - Maps service IDs to names  
- `analyzeVisitPatterns()` - Analyzes client visit patterns including:
  - Visit frequency calculation
  - Preferred time patterns (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Favorite service-staff pairs
  - Average days between visits

### 2. Preference Manager (`src/services/context/preference-manager.js`)
Created new service for managing "as usual" preferences:
- Tracks usage counts for services, staff, and combinations
- Automatically saves preferences after successful bookings
- Determines "usual context" after 3+ uses
- Categories time preferences (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Supports preference cleanup for old data

### 3. Updated Prompt Builder (`src/services/ai-admin-v2/modules/main-prompt-builder.js`)
Enhanced `buildClientInfo()` to include:
- Resolved staff and service names
- Visit patterns description
- Service-staff pair preferences
- Visit frequency in natural language

## Technical Details

### Key Algorithms

#### Visit Frequency Calculation
```javascript
const daysBetweenVisits = visits.map((v, i) => {
  if (i === 0) return null;
  return Math.floor((new Date(v.date) - new Date(visits[i-1].date)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
}).filter(Boolean);

const avgDays = daysBetweenVisits.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / daysBetweenVisits.length;
```

#### Pattern Detection
- Time patterns: Categorizes visits by time of day
- Service-staff pairs: Tracks combinations used 2+ times
- Frequency description: Converts average days to natural language

### Data Structure Example
```javascript
{
  visitPatterns: {
    frequency: "примерно раз в месяц",
    preferredTimes: ["afternoon"],
    favoriteServices: ["Стрижка"],
    favoriteStaff: ["Сергей"],
    serviceStaffPairs: [
      { service: "Стрижка", staff: "Сергей", count: 3 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Test Results

Successfully tested with message "Хочу записаться как обычно":
1. System correctly loaded enriched client context
2. AI understood the "as usual" request
3. Selected appropriate service based on context
4. Provided relevant response when no slots available

### Performance Metrics
- Context loading: 664ms (with enrichment)
- Full request processing: ~12 seconds
- Cache effectiveness: Working as expected

## Deployment
- Committed to branch: `feature/redis-context-cache`
- Deployed to production: September 1, 2025, 20:45
- Worker restarted: `ai-admin-worker-v2`

## Impact
1. **Better personalization**: Bot now knows client preferences
2. **Natural interactions**: Supports "как обычно" requests
3. **Improved context**: Shows actual names instead of IDs
4. **Pattern recognition**: Understands client behavior

## Next Steps
1. Monitor preference accuracy over time
2. Consider adding seasonal pattern detection
3. Implement preference override commands
4. Add analytics for preference usage

## Lessons Learned
1. Always map IDs to human-readable names in client-facing data
2. Pattern analysis provides valuable context for AI
3. "As usual" functionality requires careful preference tracking
4. Modular design (separate PreferenceManager) improves maintainability
