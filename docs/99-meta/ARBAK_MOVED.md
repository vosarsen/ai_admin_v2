# Arbak Onboarding Documentation Has Moved

The Arbak onboarding documentation has been reorganized for better clarity.

**New location:** `docs/onboarding/arbak/`

## Quick Links

- Main onboarding: `docs/onboarding/arbak/README.md`
- Quick reference: `docs/onboarding/arbak/CHEAT_SHEET.md`
- Resources (for other projects): `docs/onboarding/arbak/resources/`
- Methodology: `docs/onboarding/arbak/methodology/`

## Why the Move?

1. Better organization (separate learning from reference)
2. Clear entry point (README.md convention)
3. Cleaner naming (removed redundant ARBAK_ prefix)
4. Future-proof structure (room for other team members' onboarding)
